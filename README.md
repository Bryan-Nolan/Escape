# Escape

## The Story

    You are a prisoner in a max security prison which 3 layers to get to freedom.  However, the guards are very forgetful and need help remembering the 4-digit pin of each keypad.  You are in the first inner layer where you encounter a keypad door, the first of 3.  As you get closer to freedom the number of wrong guesses decreases.  Best of Luck.  

## The Rules

    1. You must only enter 4 digits and click check mark
    2. You will be show in the adjacent display box which digits are right and if in correct place.
    3. For a correct digit in correct place you will get a C
    4. For a correct digit in the wrong place you will get a X
    5. For a bad digit whic is nor in code you will get B.
    6. Previous guesses will appear along side with followig format of 1st Digit Guess 1st Result and so on. 
    5. When you click HINT you will receive the next correct digit. e.g. if you were correct on digit 1 and 2 you will receive digit 3 in display box in different colour to help you.
    6. Asking for HINT loses 3 guesses so when you have only 2 guesses left you will be unable to click. 
    7. The number of guesses for each level are as follows.
        1. Level 1 - 20 guesses
        2. Level 2 - 15 guesses
        3. Level 3 - 10 guesses
    8. If all guesses are used the game restarts at level 1.
