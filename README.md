## Escape - The Game
    
Escape is a puzzle game.  It is a logical game where the user will use clues to be able to guess the code correctly. I have designed it with a retro feel to give an old style and funky look to the interface.

## User

The target for this game is a quick puzzle game which would appeal to users who like using logical thinking and a competitive nature to try and beat old scores.  It is designed with mobile and tablet users in mind and as a game which can be enjoyed while on the bus or sitting on couch.  This game should appeal to all ages and especially anyone who enjoys puzzle games. 

I have designed this game for the user to be able to naviagte and play quiet easily with all keys an dbutton and all interactive requires are on the screen.  So weather using a mouse or finger it will be easy to use.

## Responsive

![Responsive](https://github.com/Bryan-Nolan/Escape/blob/main/assets/readme-images/Responsive.jpg)

In these times of multiple devices accessing websites, I have decided to make my site responsive to the following sizes

Screen Size below 1280 pixels which to me equates to Laptop Screen.
Screen Size below 768 pixels which to equates to tablet
Screen Size below 500 pixels to suit large phone.
Screen Size below 350 pixels to mobile.

## The Story

Every game needs a good back story to intice the users imagination to give that extra element of fantasy and excitment for the user. 

You are a prisoner wrongfully convicted by a corrupt government. A fall guy to protect more powerful people.
The government has been infiltrated by Reptile People at the highest levels and you have been locked up to keep your silence.
The Reptile people plan to release a toxic gas to kill all humans so the clock is ticking and you are the only one who knows how to stop all this.
You find yourself in a corridor with a keypad door. Beyond this door is freedom and saving the world.
All you have to do is crack the code. No pressure the fate of the world depends on you.
Good Luck, we need you !
