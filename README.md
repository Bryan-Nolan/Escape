# Escape

## The Story

    You are a prisoner in a max security prison which 3 layers to get to freedom.  However, the guards are very forgetful and need help remembering the 4-digit pin of each keypad.  You are in the first inner layer where you encounter a keypad door, the first of 3.  As you get closer to freedom the number of wrong guesses decreases.  Best of Luck.  

## The Rules

    1. You must only enter 4 digits and click check mark
    2. You will be show in the adjecent display box which digits are right and if in corecet place.
    3. For a correct digit in correct place you will get a O
    4. For a correct digit in the wrong place you will get a X
    5. When you click HINT you will recieve the next correct digit. eg if you were correct on digit 1 and 2 you will recieve digit 3 in display box in different color to help you.
    6. Asking for HINT loses 3 guesses so when you have only 2 guesses left you will be unable to click. 
    7. The amount of guesses for each level are as follows.
        1. Level 1 - 20 guesses
        2. Level 2 - 15 guesses
        3. Level 3 - 10 guesses
    8. If all guesses are used the game restarts at level 1.
